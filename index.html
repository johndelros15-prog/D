                    <p class="fade-in">Hello gorgeous🫶🏻, before this year ends, I want to tell you everything that's been in my heart. And if you want to share too, I hope you do, not because you have to, but because it might help you feel lighter as we welcome the new year with gentle smiles.</p>
                    
                    <p class="fade-in">These past days, you've been feeling something, right? Maybe it's pressure, from life, from everything happening around you. If any of that pressure is about me, I don't want you to carry it, okay? I don't want you to feel overwhelmed. I may not fully know what you're going through, but I know it's not easy.</p>
                    
                    <p class="fade-in">To be honest, I didn't like what happened, and I'm not completely happy about it. But I'm doing my best, and I hope you are too. I don't want what happened, but I accept that some things can't be changed, and that's okay. Please don't feel guilt, and don't pity me, only I, BILLY can get to do that. I'm learning how to move forward, and I want us to move forward in a healthy way, together.</p>
                    
                    <p class="fade-in highlight">I made a promise, right? <em>"Hindi ako aalis sa tabi mo."</em></p>
                    
                    <p class="fade-in">And I meant that, not as pressure, but as sincerity. I'm not here for you, I'm here WITH you. I'm not here to fix you, I'm here to UNDERSTAND you, to FEEL things with you.</p>
                    
                    <p class="fade-in">And while you're reading this, I want you to know something important, even if you like me now, I don't want us to rush into anything. My focus right now is becoming better, growing, and being successful. I believe good things come when the time is right. You matter to me, and because you do, I want things to be healthy, steady, and real.</p>
                    
                    <p class="fade-in">Don't worry too much about me, okay? You don't need to do anything or prove anything. Life is tough, and pain is part of living, it reminds us that we're growing. What we're going through isn't easy, but remind you that God gives his hardest battles to his strongest knights.</p>

                        <p>I don't know what name to give this connection yet, and maybe it doesn't need one. All I know is that somewhere along the way, my heart chose you quietly, without asking for permission or certainty.</p>

                            <p>Not for what you can offer me.</p>
                            <p>I love the way you speak softly.</p>
                            <p>The way you carry yourself with care.</p>
                            <p>You inspire me to grow and change.</p>
                            <p>You care for me in ways unspoken.</p>
                            <p>And I care for you just the same.</p>
                            <p>With you, I've found a safe place.</p>
                            <p>I don't trust easily, but I trust you.</p>
                            <p>You make want to become more than I am.</p>
                            <p>My heart feels lighter when we talk.</p>
                            <p>With you, happiness feels so natural.</p>
                            <p>I don't want you to slip away.</p>
                            <p>So I'll love you every single day.</p>
